      <h2>Proposition: Abortion clinic availability is linked to a decrease in abortion rates</h2>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

          <figcaption>BRIEF CAPTION HERE.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Reversed x-axis: this is somewhat truthful in the sense of showing a decrease. The goal here was to highlight
            the decrease in abortion rates. By changing the perspective of decrease to be the "positive" x-direction the negative
            association is more quickly made.
            We considered flipping the y-axis instead. This did produce a trendline with a similar slope, but the decrease was not as obvious
            after taking a closer look at the axes.
            <b>(Score = 0.5)</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            Only Eastern states with a net removal of abortion clinics were shown. The goal here was to find some general
            US region that shared a similar change over the 3 years. This plot involved a bit of cherry picking as we tested
            all cardinal directions and this subset had the most obvious trend with three "clusters" (Rhode Island isn't really a cluster,
            but it follows the trendline closely). After selecting these Eastern states we further subsetted for states where
            abortion clinics in the state decreased. We considered including all US states and not subsetting by region, 
            however this trendline wasn't as convincing due to the cluster of states around x=0 which had a net change of 0 abortion clinics
            and varying changes in abortion rates.
            <b>(Score = -2)</b>
            <br>To be clear, the following states were included
            under the Eastern grouping (even if they weren't plotted once we subsetted for a decrease in clinics): Maine, Vermont, 
            New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, 
            Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The change reported is over a specific 3 year period which may not reflect larger trends across different presidencies. We chose 2017-2020 
            as opposed to other years as this time frame included the start of a president who brought new ideas on abortion policy. 
            Since the changes were (nearly) across Trump's entire term, this seemed to be a good indicator of the immediate impact of
            his policies.
            <b>(Score = 1)</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            When setting our axes we increased the gap between y-ticks and decreased the gap between x-ticks. This elongated our slope,
            indicating there was more of a decreasing relationship than actually occurred. While we didn't directly manipulate any 
            tick spacing (i.e. changing proportions), we changed how the trendline/data points might be interpreted at glance.

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img class="plot" src="./template_files/propC_against_flat.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
          <figcaption>The median resident abortion rate stays within a narrow range and the IQR ribbons overlap
          widely, indicating no clear separation of outcomes by clinic availability when measured at the state level.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Summarize with 5 bins and plot each bin's median with an IQR ribbon - reduces overplotting near 90–100% and emphasizes central tendency</li>
          <li>Fade and shrink raw points as x tends to 100% - De-emphasizes the dense cluster at high 'no-clinic' percentages so attention stays on the summarized bands rather than
          on potentially contrary individual states</li>
          <li>Tighten the y-axis to the IQR envelope and the x axis to the bounds of the bins</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <!-- For -->
        <p>
        </p>

        <!-- Against -->
        <p>
          We learned that small, defensible choices can strongly shape perception even when the underlying relationship is weak.
          For the against view, binning the access variable and showing connected medians + IQR bands emphasized overlapping
          central tendencies, while a tighter y-range and faded raw points near 90–100% guided attention away from dense,
          potentially contrary individual states. Ethically, we disclosed scope (“legally recorded abortions only”) and labeled
          the summaries, but we recognize that connecting medians and compressing the scale are persuasive choices that can
          downplay within-bin variance.
